<h1>SIT223-SIT753 - Professional Practice in IT</h1>
<p>To be successful IT graduates need to understand the use of industry tools and practices, the ways these tools work and connect together, and the underlying professional, ethical, and teamwork knowledge and skills needed to put these into practice in a professional manner. This unit introduces students to IT workflows, agile project management, dev-ops pipelines, version control, and the ways these tools fit together in modern companies. The use of these technologies is underpinned by the behaviours, teamwork, and ethical considerations needed to engage in working in IT in a professional manner. The unit will tackle the big issues facing the IT industry with a focus on gender equity and diversity, helping ensure our future IT leaders are well placed to address this and other challenging issues.</p>
